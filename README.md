# Presenter
Presenter is an application for High Fidelity (www.highfidelity.com). 

PRESENTER is a tool for showing slides from Slides.com. This script will let you choose your presentation in Slides and create a speaker view in front as well as a presentation behind you (your avatar). You need rez-rights to use it in a domain.

Note that the field for the presentation should contain the presentation-slug, not the name of the presentation. The presentation should also be set as "public".

When the speaker view opens in front you will need to log in to your slides.com account to use the tool.
